# CS-305

- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

In this term we are given a scenario of developing and applying testing to a program for our client Artemis Financial Practices. Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that develops financial plans for it clients. Working with currency Artemis Financial requires a program that will be safe and secure for it users. The service we will provide for Artemis is developing a program that I will be working on is developing the functionality of the program and ensuring that there are no cut corners with full coverage testing using dependency-check testing. 

- What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

What I have done well in my opinion was adapting to the new technology that were required for the project. I had not prior knowledge in Dependency-checks testing but applying my time to research and practice them made me feel very confident. Learning about data breaches and negligence in programs lead to the serious consequences to the company. Having a form of testing and analysis in place in the development phase ensures that the program is fin tuned to the order for with it is designed to do with little to no error. Having these measures in place gives the company a high credit for the safety and privacy of its users. 

- What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most challenging portion of the vulnerability assessment that was challenging for me was generating the keystore via the command line.  The issue was following the direction on entering the commands, but it always generated an error. After close examination of the command that was on the resource material the provided command had an error. After fixing that issue then occurred a new error. The error read that I did not have permission to invoke such command. Understanding the message, I needed the command line to have admin capabilities so I reopened the command line and run with admin permissions.

- How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

By carefully examining the CVE report and reading the deprecated reports we are given a forensic information in regards to the vulnerability thar exists. In the case for the project the majority of the dependencies vulnerable where contributed to outdated and unsupported versions. In the future the mitigation techniques that will be in place is running a dependency check of a project monthly to eliminate the possibility of attacks.

- How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Working with cipher to ensure that my program was running properly was by running the spring-boot server that opens up the https window in the browser. Entering my code I can have a visual of the output by running the server.

- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The tools that I utilized for these projects where dependency-check package along OWASP documentation to check the CEV codes. with the guidance of a Google search help me greatly through the process of this course. 

- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

In the future event of me sitting down with a future employer what I would present is the encryption algorithm I have made for encrypting data using the RSA SHA-256 bit encryption. Another aspect I would display to the developer is my ability to generate a Dependency-check of a working product and identify the vulnerabilities.
